Nattō (納豆), spelled as natto in standard English language use, is a traditional Japanese food made from whole soybeans that have been fermented with Bacillus subtilis var. natto.[1] It is often served as a breakfast food with rice.[2] It is served with karashi mustard, soy or tare sauce, and sometimes Japanese bunching onion. Within Japan, nattō is most popular in the eastern regions, including Kantō, Tōhoku, and Hokkaido.[3]

Nattō is often considered an acquired taste because of its powerful smell, strong flavor, and sticky, slimy texture.[4][5][6][7][8] A 2009 survey revealed that 70% of Japanese people find the taste pleasant, and others who may not find the taste of the food pleasant still eat it out of habit.[9]
