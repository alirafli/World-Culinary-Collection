A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) or singara is a fried South Asian[2] pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.

The English word samosa derives from Hindustani word 'samosa' (Urdu: سموسہ, Hindi: समोसा),[6] traceable to the Middle Persian word sanbosag (سنبوسگ)[7] 'triangular pastry'.[8] Similar pastries are called sambusak in Arabic; Medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it sambusaj.[9]

Spanakopita is a similar dish cooked in Greece.
